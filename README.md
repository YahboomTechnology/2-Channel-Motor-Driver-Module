# 2-Channel Motor Drive Module(support 5-12V power supply)
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/2-Channel-Motor-Driver-Module/blob/main/MotorDriveModule.jpg)
# Introduction
This dual-channel motor drive module is designed based on AT8236 chip, which can drive 2-channel motors with Hall encoder at the same time. Supports 5-12V voltage power input and has input anti-reverse connection protection. At the same time, it has its own voltage stabilizing circuit, which supports 5V/3A high current or 3.3V/500mA output for power supply of the main board. The rated driving current of single-circuit motor is 3.6A, and the maximum peak current can reach 6A. It possess over-current protection, short circuit protection, under-voltage locking, over-temperature protection circuit, etc. On-board VM voltage detection circuit can read the power supply voltage in real time. At the same time, it supports cascade power supply between multiple modules to realize 2WD/4WD and other smart car.
# Features
* On-board AT8236 driver chip, can drive 2-channel motor(TT DC motor, motor with encoder, 520 motor, 310 motor).
* Adopt professional circuit design (anti-reverse connection protection, voltage stabilizing circuit, voltage detection circuit).
* Power interface (KF301-2P/spacing 5.08MM/vertical-type) supports input and output, and can realize the cascade between modules.
* Screw hole position of the expansion board corresponds to the Raspberry Pione by one, and applicable to a variety of different development boards and experimental projects.
